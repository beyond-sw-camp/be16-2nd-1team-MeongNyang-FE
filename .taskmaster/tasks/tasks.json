        "details": "For each major feature (authentication, pet registration, diary, marketplace, chat), use Playwright MCP to generate and refine executable test scripts that mirror real user interactions. Begin by crafting natural language prompts describing the desired test flows (e.g., 'Test user signup, login, and logout with valid and invalid credentials' for authentication). Use Playwright MCP's AI-driven workflow to convert these prompts into Playwright test code, then manually review and enhance the generated scripts for robustness and maintainability. Ensure each test covers both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases (e.g., duplicate pet registration, invalid diary input, failed marketplace transactions, chat message delivery under network interruptions). Structure tests using Playwright's best practices: organize by feature, use fixtures for setup/teardown, and leverage selectors resilient to UI changes. Annotate code with comments for clarity. Integrate these scripts into the project's E2E test suite, ensuring compatibility with CI pipelines. Reference recent Playwright MCP usage patterns, such as prompt-driven test generation, snapshot-based UI interaction, and iterative refinement for reliability[1][2][3][4][5].",
        "testStrategy": "For each feature, execute the Playwright MCP-generated tests locally and in the CI environment. Validate that all critical user flows pass, including both typical and edge cases. Review test output, screenshots, and logs to confirm correct behavior. Simulate error conditions (e.g., invalid input, network failures) and verify that tests detect and report failures accurately. Ensure tests are stable across environments and maintainable as the UI evolves. Peer-review test code for clarity and completeness.",
